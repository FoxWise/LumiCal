    Collected cluster in calorimeter

    pad, sector - position of the cluster (TOWERS were used for clustering)
    x, y - same, but in Cartesian coorinates
    energy - total energy of all cells in cluster
    n_pads - number of towers which create a cluster

    get_energy() - calculates cluster energy based on signal's data
    get_position() - calculates cluster position based on signal's data
    get_n_pads() - calculates number of pads in cluster based on signal's data
    merge() - update properties of cluster "self" if it was merged with cluster2.
    Sum energy and number of pads. Calculate new weighted average position.
    Do nothing with cluster2. Should be deleted in the code!
