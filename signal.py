class Signal:
    '''
    Signal in the detector
    Attributes:
    sector, pad, layer - position of the signal
    energy - energy of the signal
    neighbor - the most energetic neighbor of the signal or itself.
    x, y - coordinates of signal in x, y.
    cluster - cluster index to which the signal was asigned

    position() - method to calculate position of the signal
    based on apv's id and channel where signal was recorded
    calib_energy - method to calculate calibrated energy of the
    signal.It uses: calibration files for this apv, recorded signal
    value of ADC (Voltage) in apv.
